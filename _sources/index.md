# A brief, opinionated introduction to the Fokker-Planck equation

Notes for the INM-6 book club of 12 August 2022, given by Alexandre Ren√© and Alexander van Meegen.

The presentation is split into three parts:

- Derivation of the Fokker-Planck equation (FPE) from the Kramers-Moyal expansion
- Tight relationship between stochastic differential equations and the FPE.
- Picturing probability flow as advection-diffusion in a liquid.

The first parts are based on the classic text by {cite:t}`
riskenFokkerPlanckEquationMethods1996`.
